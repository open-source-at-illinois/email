subject: General Meeting + Hacktoberfest Hangout

Hiya everyone!

This Saturday (Oct. 17th), we'll be having our General Meeting at 12:30PM CT!
In the beginning, we will be breaking up into project groups to make sure people are caught up on what they need to know.
We have plans to show off our club's projects at the Engineering Expo this year, so if you want in, be sure to come!

We'll talk about projects for about 20-30 minutes.
Here is the Zoom link we will be using for the project meeting: [hidden Zoom Link]. 
The meeting ID is [hidden ID], and the password is [hidden password].

After that, we'll be hosting a "Hacktoberfest Hangout", where we can all hang out, talk about anything (including open-source topics!), and work on personal *fun* projects -- **no** homework allowed! 
Bonus points if your projects are open source.
If you're interested in the whole Hacktoberfest PR-Tshirt shtick and want to talk with other people also interested in Hacktoberfest, you are welcome to join us! We'll host this hangout on Discord.


Well, that's all we have for today! Hope to see you Saturday! 


Best,


OSAI Exec
