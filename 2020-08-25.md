subject: Opportunity to show off your resume!
---

Hey folks, we've got another announcement to make! 

Engineering Expo is presenting their very first Reverse Career Fair this semester, where companies seek out RSOs to form partnerships with the RSO and their members. One aspect of this is that RSO members have the opportunity to submit their resume to show to companies -- that means *you*!

If you'd like to get your resume out there for companies to see, then upload your resume as a PDF to this form: <https://forms.gle/yrXNPWfeyAdqsipF9>.

This form will close on Friday (August 28th) at 11:59PM CT. If you'd like to submit your resume for this event, please fill out this form by then! 

Best,

OSAI Exec
