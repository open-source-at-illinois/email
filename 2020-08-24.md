Hey everybody!

Hopefully your first day of classes wasn't too rough :p Also, to those of you we saw at Virtual Quad Day, thanks for dropping in last weekend! 
Here are a couple of updates regarding upcoming events:

This Saturday (Aug. 29th), we'll be hosting our very first virtual social this semester so that you can unwind after your first week back to classes~ You'll get a chance to meet people and to play games with everyone! We have a bunch of choices for games, ranging from the JackBox party packs to Codenames! 

Furthermore, we'll be hosting our first official meeting the week after (Sept. 5th). We'll talk about what this club is about, and what sorts of things we have lined up for you to get involved this semester!

You might've noticed that we didn't specify a time for either of these events. If you're interested in the social or the interest meeting, please fill out this form so that we can make the times as reasonable for as many people as possible. We'll be taking responses until Wednesday (Aug. 26th), 11:59PM CT, and we'll announce the time for the social on Thursday (Aug. 27th):

See you all then!
