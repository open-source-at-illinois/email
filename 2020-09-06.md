Hey everyone!

Thank you to those who came to the interest meeting this past Saturday! Unfortunately, the interest meeting had not been recorded due to error. However, you can find the interest meeting slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Hcvrjf8mu1OiLcNlM8f_9qbJ6NqKXi4al8f6swbDfCw/edit?usp=sharing).

Now, for announcements:

* If you are a new OR returning member that has not already done so, please fill out our member verification form at <https://tinyurl.com/osai-verify-fa2020>. This is required for GitHub Organization access, and we will be using it to track official club membership.

* Sahan's "Intro to Git" workshop will be held on Saturday, September 12th! Git is a version control system used widely in the open-source community, and the workshop will cover the essentials of Git for you to start contributing! The time and medium (Zoom vs. Discord) of the workshop are TBA, but we will send announcements through all channels when the details have been established.

* Hacktoberfest is coming up soon! Hacktoberfest is an event hosted by DigitalOcean for the entire month of October to promote open-source contributions. Keep an eye out for more announcements on our end regarding Hacktoberfest!

That's all we have for now! Have a great and safe Labor Day, everybody!

Best,

O-SAI Exec.
