subject: A New Semester for Open-Source at Illinois!
---

Welcome back to the new semester! We hope that you've all been doing well this past summer.

With a fresh semester comes a fresh opportunity to get involved in Open-Source! Come talk to us about our plans, projects, and activities for the club this Fall at *Virtual Quad Day (August 22nd and 23rd, from 12PM-4PM Central Time)*. Old members and new members alike are welcome!

You'll want to direct yourself to this URL to find the Zoom link: https://illinois.campuslabs.com/engage. If you don't want to use Zoom, just head to our Discord, and ping us by sending "@Exec" in the #quad-day channel -- we'll be more than happy to talk to you over voice chat!

We hope to see you all there!

Sincerely,

The OSAI Exec Team
