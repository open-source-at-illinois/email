Hey everybody,

Welcome to Open-Source @ Illinois! Before we go over some upcoming events, we'd like to go over a few things first:

Whether this is the first time or the last time you've gotten an email from us, our club page on CampusLabs provides some essential information about us: click [here](https://illinois.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/open-source-at-illinois){target="blank"} to go to it. It includes a link to our Google calendar for upcoming events, our Instagram, and a link to our Discord (which we'll be using as our main hub of operations this year). You can also join our Discord by checking the bottom of this email. :) 

That being said, here's a quick run-down of some of the things we've got going on:

* Engineering Expo is presenting their very first Reverse Career Fair this semester, where companies seek out RSOs to form partnerships. One part of this is that RSOs have the opportunity to submit their members' resumes to show to companies, so if you'd like to show off your resume, upload a PDF of your resume to [this Google Form](https://forms.gle/yrXNPWfeyAdqsipF9){target="blank"}! The form will close by this Friday (August 28th), 11:59PM CT. 

* We'll be hosting our very first online social this semester through Discord this Saturday (August 29th) at 1:00PM CT! It's a great day for winding down after the first week of classes, so come on down and hang out -- we'll have an assortment of activities to choose from, from Codenames to JackBox party packs, and more!

* Our Interest Meeting will be held next Saturday (September 5th)! We'd like to accommodate as many people as possible, so we haven't set a time yet. If you haven't yet filled out a Time Zone form, please do so at [this link](https://forms.gle/Zftc6FLNG3JrzVzA6){target="blank"}. We'll be closing *this* form Tuesday of next week (September 1st), at 11:59PM CT, and we'll announce the time of the Interest Meeting on September 2nd. 

We hope to see you soon!

Best,

O-SAI Exec
