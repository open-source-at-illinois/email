subject: General Meeting and Projects!

Hello everybody!

Thank you to those who came to our Git workshop!
To those who missed it, you can find a link to the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QXkdPvh226l2I1SwEYRkn0XwJnLBaoVZD53xJMZKiUw/edit?usp=sharing).
Feel free to go through it by yourself! ;)

We will be hosting our next general meeting this Saturday (Sept. 19th) at 12:30PM CT on Zoom. 
Along with some updates about the club and Hacktoberfest, we'll be discussing current projects and ideas for projects in the club for you to get involved this semester! 

If you're interested in doing some cool projects with us, please fill out the form here: <https://forms.gle/7hY17n8qKCfeCRxk7>.
The purpose of this first form is to simply gauge what kinds of topics everybody would be willing to pursue, and to gauge how much experience everybody has with those topics.
This survey is non-binding and won't be used to assign groups or anything like that.
That said, it may have an impact on the pool of projects available for selection.
You'll have to sign in to your Illinois Google account in order to fill the form out, and it will close at 10:59PM CT on Friday.

Click [here](https://illinois.zoom.us/j/98402694725?pwd=c0RZUkVEY0llbWhwaUhsSXBOSjFQUT09) for the Zoom link for the upcoming meeting.
If Zoom asks for a password, enter "osai" (without the quotes).
Hope to see you there!


Have a good night,


O-SAI Exec.
