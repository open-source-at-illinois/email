Hello everybody!

We've got a LOT to talk about, so hold on to your seats!

First off: Hacktoberfest is starting tomorrow! Sign up for Hacktoberfest [here](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).
Because they'll only be distributing T-shirts to the first 70k participants who complete their tasks, we'll be aiming to host events where we can all work together to find open-source projects to contribute to.

Feel free to use the `#contributing` channel to your heart's content to ask for help about making contributions, finding repositories, and for anything else related to contributing to open-source software.

Also: we have an Intro Javascript workshop this Thursday! See our September 22nd email (linked [here](https://github.com/open-source-at-illinois/email/blob/master/2020-09-22.md)) for the Zoom link and for specifics.

Now, for some more internal stuff:

Firstly, we now have a process for you to propose your own workshops/meetings! If you want to create a workshop, head on over to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/open-source-at-illinois/workshops) and propose a workshop by following the instructions in the `README.md`! If you have any questions about the process, whether it's designing a workshop or the actual process of submitting it, feel free to reach out to `@Exec` (ping `@Sahan` if you need help with figuring out the submission). 
All future workshops (and upcoming workshops) will be posted here: <https://open-source-at-illinois.github.io/workshops/>

Secondly, about projects: we will be spearheading the two projects that recieved the most votes from our last general meeting:

- App to send notifications and reminders for classes, due dates, calendar for all classes, assignments, note-taking, Zoom links, etc.

- App to drag-and-drop files between devices (tablet, computer, phone) on the same network

If you're interested in either of these projects, please send a message into `#verified` indicating which projects you would like to be a part of -- "ClassApp", "Drag'n Drop", or both!
(These names are temporary, of course. As long as you're clear about it, we'll know what you're talking about) :^)
We'll be assigning Discord roles so that we can all more easily communicate.

Please note that these are just the "official" projects we're leading for the time being.
We're leaving the `#fa20-voting-projects` channel open for people to discuss the other projects and maybe independently start them!



Finally, an update about club operations: because we want to open up as many opportunities as possible for people to get involved, we'll start hosting meetings and get-togethers at more time slots than just 12:30PM CT on Saturdays. For projects, we'll coordinate based on the availability of those involved, and for other events, we'll start regularly scheduling on Wednesday nights (times TBD).

Phew, that was a lot! We hope to hear from you all soon!

Have a good night,

OSAI Exec
