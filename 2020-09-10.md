subject: Intro to Git Workshop this Saturday!
---

Hi everybody!

We'll be hosting our very first git workshop this Saturday (Sept. 12th) at 12:30PM CT! Git is a version control system widely used in the open-source community, and learning it is crucial to making contributions. We'll be going over the basics of git, covering topics like making repositories, making commits and branches, and publishing to GitHub. If you haven't installed Git already, please make sure you've installed it by 12:30PM CT so that you can dive right into learning. We'll upload an installation instructions video for Windows into the Discord #workshops channel, but if you decide install Git on your own, we'll also put some things that you should be mindful of when configuring your install. Note: Linux and macOS should already have git installed (or configurable), but if not, send us a message in the Discord.

We'll be active on Discord in case you guys run into any trouble or need any clarification, and we'll open the video call 30 minutes before the workshop start time in case you're still having problems.

Here is the Zoom link where the workshop will be hosted: <https://illinois.zoom.us/j/96723010511?pwd=TkFwMGJCVC9TOStEY2llaXVEa0JIZz09>

Hope to see you then! 

Best,
