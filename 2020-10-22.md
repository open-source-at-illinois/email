subject: General Meeting and Among Us
---
Hey everybody!


First, a reminder that we'll have our General Meeting this Saturday (Oct.24th) at 12:30PM CT. Once again, we'll be using this time to host project meetings.

Here is the Zoom link that we'll be using.
If you need it, the meeting ID is [hidden ID], and the password is [hidden password]: [hidden Zoom Link]

Also, we'll be playing Among Us Saturday night (at 9:00PM CT) on Discord as well! If you don't have Among Us already, you can either buy it for desktop on Steam for a couple of dollars, or you can play for free on mobile.

Hope to see you there!


Best,

OSAI Exec.
