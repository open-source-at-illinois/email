Hello everyone!

To those who missed our General Meeting today, here are the slides: <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SPJ5OtDLx9gBDyQ6R9pmrqvqdvazQ45VQ-BB-a8dk_E/edit?usp=sharing>

We have now opened voting for projects! This is how voting will work:

* Head over to the `#voting` channel on our Discord. You will need to verify your GitHub in order to vote: if you haven't done so already, complete our verification form [here](https://tinyurl.com/osai-verify-fa2020).

* If there is a project idea in the channel that you'd like to pursue, react to it! If not, then leave it be (it makes counting easier). Voting multiple times is a-okay! 

* If you want to add a project idea, you can do so in `#voting`. Please keep it to one message per idea. Feel free to post multiple project ideas, but keep conversation about project ideas in `#ideas` so voting can be done cleanly. 

* If you've yet to fill out our project interest form, please do so [here](https://forms.gle/7hY17n8qKCfeCRxk7). This helps us to get a sense of the background of people who are interested in projects.


We'll close open project suggestions on Sunday (Sept. 20th), 11:59PM CT (additions will be on a case-by-case basis), and we'll close voting on Tuesday (Sept. 22nd), 11:59PM CT.

Now, for announcements: 

* We'll be hosting our HTML/CSS+Javascript workshop next Saturday (Sept 26th) at 12:30PM CT! More details will be released as the date approaches.

* Hacktoberfest is coming soon! Hacktoberfest is an event hosted by DigitalOcean to promote open-source contributions. Click [here](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) for more information and to sign up for their newsletter.

That's all we've got for now -- have a good evening everybody!

Best,

O-SAI Exec.
