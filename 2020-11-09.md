subject: Jekyll Workshop on Wednesday (11/11) at 8PM CT!

Hey everybody!

We're announcing our very first Jekyll workshop! It will be hosted on November 11th at 8PM CT in the Discord voice channel, and it will officially run for about an hour. If you wanted to get involved in the club but didn't know where to begin, this is a good place to start! Of course, if you just want to learn about Jekyll, you're welcome too. A "nice-to-have" prerequisite is a **basic** understanding of HTML and CSS, but if you don't have that, that's alright -- we'll be going over it anyway.

Jekyll is a static site generator that makes it easy to develop and maintain static webpages generated from Markdown. It also has excellent integration with GitHub Pages, so if you've seen a live website with `.github.io`, there's a pretty good chance that it's been made with Jekyll.

This workshop will be a 15 minute presentation hosted by exec (consisting of a rundown of Jekyll concepts), and then 45 minutes of you working and thinking through designing a Jekyll template from scratch! Sahan will be hanging around on Discord to help you guys out with the workshop, and to help with more tedious things like Ruby installation. If you can't hang around for longer than the 15 minute presentation, that's alright! You can complete the workshop on your own time after attending the presentation and post questions into #workshops. Bonus: if you complete the workshop, you'll get a special shoutout on the club Discord. ;)

Well, that's all for the announcement -- hope to see you all there!


Best,


OSAI Exec.
