subject: General Meeting - Project Kickoff and Open Discussion
---

Hello everybody!

We will be hosting a General Meeting on Saturday (October 11th) at 12:30PM CT on Zoom! Here is a rough outline of what will happen:

First, we'll go over some basic announcements with regards to the club. 
Then, we'll be splitting up into two breakout rooms to talk about the projects: the class organizer app and the file-transfer app.

We'll be talking about the logistics of the projects for about 20 or so minutes, and then we'll come back and have an open discussion about what you want to see in this club!

Here is the Zoom link we will be using: <https://illinois.zoom.us/j/89587525374?pwd=bDBJQlM1OHZkSlh5RXdaZ0hvRldWUT09>. The meeting ID is `895 8752 5374`. If a password is asked for, simply enter `osai`.

We're excited for what's to come, and we hope you are too -- hope to see you Saturday!

Have a good night,

OSAI Exec
