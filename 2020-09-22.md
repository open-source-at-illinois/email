Hey everybody!

Weâ€™ll be hosting a series of workshops on Web-development starting from September 26th. We will be learning the fundamentals of Web-dev with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The series will be divided into two parts: 

1) HTML/CSS on September 26th 12:30pm, where we will implement simple static web pages.

2) Javascript on October 3rd 12:30pm, where we will make a functional calculator.

Prerequisites:

* No coding experience needed, and these workshops are only and ONLY for beginners in web-dev.

* Be ready with your favorite text editor (We recommend VScode but we won't judge you if you use Atom...just don't use Notepad). :)

In case, you need help installing a new text editor or want to ask a question about this series, just ping @karyw or @gprakarsh in the `#webdev` channel.
