Hello everybody,

In our previous email, we said that the meeting date is Saturday the 11th. That is incorrect: our next meeting date is tomorrow, Saturday the 10th of October. The time, 12:30PM CT, is still correct. Sorry for the confusion!

Here is the Zoom link we will be using: <https://illinois.zoom.us/j/89587525374?pwd=bDBJQlM1OHZkSlh5RXdaZ0hvRldWUT09>. The meeting ID is `895 8752 5374`. The password, if necessary, is `osai`.

Have a good night,

OSAI Exec
