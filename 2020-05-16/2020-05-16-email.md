Hello everybody! Hope that you have all been well after finals, because 
we have much to go over!

First and foremost, we would like to introduce the new exec team for the 
2020-2021 academic year!

* Sahan Kumarasinghe - President
* Vivian Gray - Treasurer/Social Chair
* Kary Wang - Webmaster
* Prakarsh Gupta - Project Frontend Coorganiger 
* Pauline Lu - Project Backend Coorganiger 

Secondly, we have an update regarding coding hour: 
for the duration of the summer, we'll be hosting coding hour starting at 
1pm every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday starting this week.	

Last but not least, we'll be having our very first summer social this 
coming Saturday, May 23rd at 7pm CT! We'll meet up over Zoom, and we'll 
have an assortment of activities, from Jackbox to Cards Against Humanity,
so be there, or be square!

We look forward to seeing your faces soon -- if not, we wish you 
a healthy and safe summer, and we hope to see you again next year!

Sincerely,

The New OSAI Exec Team
